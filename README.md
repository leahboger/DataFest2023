<h1>American Bar Association Data Visualization Insights</h1>
Acheivement: Best Use of External Data

<h2>Description</h2>
For Data Fest 2023, the American Bar Association shared data from an online portal where low-income status participants can get pro bono legal services. Due to the nature of the data, it was deleted from data fest participants computers after the duration of the compition. For this reason, in lieu of a knitted HTML, I will share screenshots of code and interactive plots. We sought to better understand which counties had the longest average time from question to answer on the portal. In addition, we wanted to understand how number of questions asked, as well as average response time, corresponded to a heat map of poverty in the US to inform the ABA of future areas of outreach and where to allocate resources.
